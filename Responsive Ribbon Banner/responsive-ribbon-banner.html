<!--/* Making a responsive ribbon banner
Derived from making a triangle in CSS code and inverting what is transparent and what is colored

This project shows how to use CSS to design a simple ribbon banner and JavaScript to make the banner resize based on the amount of text contained within the banner and font-size. It also uses the flexbox layout mode to ensure the ribbon remains centered in the viewport at any width 480px and above*/-->
